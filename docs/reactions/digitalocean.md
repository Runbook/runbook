The DigitalOcean Reactions are designed to allow users to automatically perform common tasks on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) cloud servers. These tasks could be for issue resolution or simply day-to-day tasks.

## Power Cycle Droplet

The **Power Cycle Droplet** Reaction is designed to allow a user to perform a hard Power Cycle of a DigitalOcean cloud server. A power cycle in DigitalOcean is equivalent to pulling the power from a server. This Reaction is useful as only a last resort, when all other Reactions were unable to resolve the issue.

## Power On Droplet

The **Power On Droplet** Reaction is designed to allow a user to power on a DigitalOcean cloud server. This Reaction is a bit of an edge case but can be used to power on a server that will take over the role of a false server.

---

## Reboot Droplet

The **Reboot Droplet** Reaction is designed to allow a user to reboot a DigitalOcean cloud server. This is a soft reboot and is generally used when other Reactions were unable to resolve the issue.

---

## Power Off Droplet

The **Power Off Droplet** Reaction is designed to allow a user to power off a DigitalOcean cloud server. Much like the **Power On Droplet** Reaction, the use of this Reaction is an edge case but for some situations it has its uses.

---

## Shutdown Droplet

The **Shutdown Droplet** Reaction is designed to allow a user to shut down a DigitalOcean cloud server. The use of this Reaction is the same as the **Power Off Droplet** Reaction. However, this reaction performs a soft shutdown where the **Power Off Droplet** Reaction is equivalent to pulling the power from a server.

## Snapshot Droplet

The **Snapshot Droplet** Reaction allows users to create a snapshot of a DigitalOcean cloud server. This Reaction may be useful for creating a quick backup of a misbehaving system for later analysis.
