            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The <b>HTTP GET: Keyword</b> monitor allows you to perform an HTTP or HTTPS <code>GET</code> request on a specific page and search for a keyword. The keyword can be both a string or a regular expression, this can be used to validate that your app is serving content correctly or search the page for errors.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Monitor Details</h3>
            
            <p>This monitor will perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> on the specified url and page; the returned text will be searched for the keyword specified.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>URL</h4>
            <p>This field is used to target the HTTP <code>GET</code> request. This can be a domain or an IP address; however the entry must be in URL format such as <code>https://10.0.0.1/index.html</code>.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Domain to request</h4>

            <p>The domain field is used to specify the <code>Host</code> header of the request. This is useful for requests that address an IP address rather than the domain itself.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Using the URL and Domain to request</h4>

            <p>If you wanted to monitor the website at <code>http://example.com/status.html</code> and example.com resolved to <code>10.0.0.1</code> and <code>10.0.0.2</code> you could monitor each server by setting up two monitors. Each monitor would address the servers IP directly and use the Domain to request field to specify which domain to validate.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h5>Example Monitor #1:</h5>
            <pre>
URL: http://10.0.0.1/status.html
Domain to request: example.com
</pre>

            <p></p>
            <h5>Example Monitor #2:</h5>
            <pre>
URL: http://10.0.0.2/status.html
Domain to request: example.com
</pre>

            <p>This would allow you to monitor each server independently, and setup unique reactions based on each server.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Keyword</h4>
            <p>The Keyword field is the string or regular expression the monitor should search for. This performs a basic search amongst all text within a page, it is important that you ensure the search text or pattern is unique to avoid false positives.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Is Keyword a Regular Expression</h4>
            <p>This selection field allows you to specify if the keyword provided is in regular expression format or not. If you are not using a regular expression you should set this to false.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Mark Healthy if keyword is present</h4>
            <p>This selection field allows you to specify whether the monitor is healthy when the keyword is present, or absent. You can specify this as false if the keyword was searching for unwanted errors such as database connection errors or any other error that would be presented as page text.</p>
