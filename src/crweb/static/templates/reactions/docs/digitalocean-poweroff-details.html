            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The DigitalOcean: Power Off Droplet reaction can be used to power off cloud servers (aka Droplets) hosted with DigitalOcean.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction will only perform a single reaction, this reaction can be configured to occur on "Failed Monitors" or "Healthy Monitors" but is not designed to be executed on both. In order to setup this reaction to have an action for "Healthy Monitors" and a different action for "Failed Monitors" you can create two reactions and attach them to the same Monitor.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Failed Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Failed Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "Failed Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to DigitalOcean requesting a power off of the droplet specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Healthy Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "Failed Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Healthy Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Healthy Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "Healthy Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to DigitalOcean requesting a power off of the droplet specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "Failed Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "Healthy Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Form Details</h3>

            <h4>API Key</h4>
            <p>The API Key field should contain your API key in the new version of DigitalOcean's API this is called a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api-v2" target="_blank">Personal Access Token</a>.</p>
<p></p>

            <h4>Droplet ID#</h4>
            <p>The Droplet ID# field should contain the ID number of the droplet you wish to power off, this can be found in the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/droplet-id-number-to-place-in-variable" target="_blank">URL of the droplet details</a>.</p>
