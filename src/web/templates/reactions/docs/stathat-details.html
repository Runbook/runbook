            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>StatHat is a service that allows you to track custom statistics and display those statistics in easy to use graphs. The StatHat reaction is designed to allow you to track monitors with StatHat's service.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>CloudRout.es Uptime</h4>
            <p>An example of this is our public stat for CloudRout.es Uptime. This graph is generated by our HTTP GET Status Code monitor and the StatHat reaction, when our webservers provide a <code>200</code> status code the StatHat reaction will send a counter value of 1 to StatHat.</p>

            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction will only perform a single reaction, this reaction can be configured to occur on "False Monitors" or "True Monitors" but is not designed to be executed on both. In order to setup this reaction to have an action for "True Monitors" and a different action for "False Monitors" you can create two reactions and attach them to the same Monitor.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>False Monitors</h4>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "False Monitor" the reaction will send the defined statistic to StatHat if the Call On field is set to "False Monitors". If the Call On field is set to "True Monitors" this reaction will do nothing.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>True Monitors</h4>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "True Monitor" the reaction will send the defined statistic to StatHat if the Call On field is set to "True Monitors". If the Call On field is set to "False Monitors" this reaction will do nothing.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Reaction Form Details</h3>

            <h4>Stat Name</h4>
            <p>The Stat Name field should contain the name of the Statistic you want to create/send to. If the stat does not already exist within your StatHat account it will be created on the first instance of this reaction executing.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>EZ Key</h4>
            <p>This field should contain the StatHat EZ Key, which is generally the email address associated with your account.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4>Stat Type</h4>
            <p>StatHat has two types of stats, <a href="https://www.stathat.com/manual/faq" target="_blank">Value's and Counter's</a>. A Value will take the specified value sent to StatHat and will be averaged, A Counter will take the specified value and add it.</p>
            <p></p>
            
            <h4>Value</h4>
            <p>The Value field should contain a value to send to StatHat; if you are using a counter stat type the most appropriate value is most likely 1.</p>
            <p></p>


            <h4>Continuous</h4>
            <p>If set to Yes, the Continuous option will tell this reaction to send the statistic every time the monitor runs. This is useful for situations such as the CloudRout.es Uptime statistic, where we are tracking every time we receive a <code>200</code> response code. If set to No, the reaction will only send a statistic each time the Monitor changes status. For example, if the reaction is set to "False Monitors" the statistic will only be sent when the monitor changes from "True" to "False" status.</p>
            <p>Be extra cautious with the <code>Trigger</code> and <code>Frequency</code> settings, as every reaction including the StatHat Reaction honors these values. If you are utilizing the Continuous feature it is most likely best to set the <code>Trigger</code> and <code>Frequency</code> values to 0.</p>
