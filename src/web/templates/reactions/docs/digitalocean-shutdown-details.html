            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The DigitalOcean: Shutdown Droplet reaction can be used to shutdown cloud servers (aka Droplets) hosted with DigitalOcean.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction will only perform a single reaction, this reaction can be configured to occur on "False Monitors" or "True Monitors" but is not designed to be executed on both. In order to setup this reaction to have an action for "True Monitors" and a different action for "False Monitors" you can create two reactions and attach them to the same Monitor.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>False Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "False Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "False Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to DigitalOcean requesting a shutdown of the droplet specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "True Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "False Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>True Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "True Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "True Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to DigitalOcean requesting a shutdown of the droplet specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "False Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "True Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Form Details</h3>

            <h4>API Key</h4>
            <p>The API Key field should contain your API key in the new version of DigitalOcean's API this is called a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-api-v2" target="_blank">Personal Access Token</a>.</p>
<p></p>

            <h4>Droplet ID#</h4>
            <p>The Droplet ID# field should contain the ID number of the droplet you wish to shutdown, this can be found in the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/droplet-id-number-to-place-in-variable" target="_blank">URL of the droplet details</a>.</p>
