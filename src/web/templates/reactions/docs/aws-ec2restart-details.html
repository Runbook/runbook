            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Amazon Web Services: Restart EC2 Instance reaction can be used to restart cloud servers (aka Instances) hosted with Amazon Web Services.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h3>Reaction Actions</h3>

            <p>This reaction will only perform a single reaction, this reaction can be configured to occur on "False Monitors" or "True Monitors" but is not designed to be executed on both. In order to setup this reaction to have an action for "True Monitors" and a different action for "False Monitors" you can create two reactions and attach them to the same Monitor.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>False Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "False Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "False Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to AWS requesting a restart of the instance specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "True Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "False Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>True Monitors</h4>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "True Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>When this reaction receives a "True Monitor" the reaction will send an API request to AWS requesting a restart of the instance specified.</p>
            <p><b>If this reaction's Call On field is set to "False Monitors".</b></p>
            <p>This reaction will perform no tasks when it receives a "True Monitor"</p>
            <p></p>
